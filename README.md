Node.js is neither a language nor framework, it's simply an environment
npm (Node Package Manager) containing a lot of open-source packages

    npm init: create package.json
    
express = framework on node, help reduce repetitive code

    npm install express
    const express = require('express')  -> require only in nodejs for loading modules
    const app = listen(3000) -> listen TCP connections on port 3000
